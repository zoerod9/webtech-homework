<h1>Welcome to Zoe's website!</h1>
<p>My name is <b>Zoe</b> and I live in <i>San Antonio, Texas</i>. I have two cats, <b>Sake</b> and <b>Chaplin</b>. They are the lights of my life but also my worst enemies. I also have a husband, <b>Vinny</b>. He is the real light of my life. <br>I grew up in <i>Seminole, Texas</i> and moved to <i>Lubbock</i> when I turned 18. That's where I met <b>Vinny</b> and we moved here, to <i>San Antonio.</i><br/></p>

<p></br><b>Don't Worry, Darling</b><br/></br><b>Poor Things</b><br/><br><b>The Devil's Candy</b><br></br><b>Stay</b><br/></br><b>Hereditary</b><br/></br><b>The Fall of the House of Usher</b> is a limited series but deserves to be on the board for how <i>great</i> it is. It's <i>not</i> about Usher, the musician. A lot of people think that. It's based on an <i>Edgar Allen Poe</i> story. Very well made and covers some important real-world issues.<br/></p>
